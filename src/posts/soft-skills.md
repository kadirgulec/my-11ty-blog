## Beyond the Code

It is easy to get lost in algorithms and syntax, but software development is a team sport.

### What I've Learned
1.  **Communication:** Explaining technical concepts to non-technical people is a superpower.
2.  **Reliability:** Delivering what you promise on time builds trust faster than clean code.
3.  **Empathy:** Understanding the user's pain points makes you build better products.

Technical skills get you the interview, but soft skills get you the job (and the promotion).
