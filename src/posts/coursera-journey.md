## Continuous Learning

In the tech world, if you stop learning, you start falling behind. I turned to **Coursera** to formalize my knowledge in computer science fundamentals.

### What I Achieved
I successfully completed the *Google IT Support Professional Certificate* and the *Python for Everybody* specialization.

1.  **Discipline:** It taught me to study on a schedule.
2.  **Fundamentals:** I learned the "why" behind the code.
3.  **Certification:** It added a nice badge to my LinkedIn profile!

It was a challenging but rewarding experience that complemented my practical coding skills perfectly.
