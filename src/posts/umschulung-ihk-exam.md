## From Newbie to Professional

The path to becoming a **Fachinformatiker (Anwendungsentwicklung)** was intense. The "Umschulung" compresses a 3-year apprenticeship into just 2 years.

### The Final Project
For my IHK exam, I had to develop a real-world application. The documentation phase was actually harder than the coding itself!

*   **Project:** A customer management system.
*   **Documentation:** 15 pages of technical specs.
*   **Presentation:** 15 minutes to convince the board.

Passing the exam was a huge milestone in my life and validated all the late nights I spent debugging code.
