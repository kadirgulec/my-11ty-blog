## Utility-First Revolution

At first, Tailwind looked ugly to me. `class="p-4 bg-red-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-red-600"`? It felt like inline styles.

### The Realization
But then I tried it.
1.  **No Context Switching:** I don't have to jump between HTML and CSS files.
2.  **Consistency:** Spacing and colors are always perfect because I'm restricted to the design system.
3.  **Speed:** I can prototype a layout in minutes.

Now, writing vanilla CSS feels like walking through mud.
