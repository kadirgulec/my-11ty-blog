## Developer Experience First

Laravel isn't just a framework; it's an ecosystem. From local development with **Herd** to deployment with **Forge** or **Vapor**, everything feels polished.

### Key Features I Love
I can't imagine going back to raw PHP after using:

*   **Eloquent ORM:** Database queries that read like English.
*   **Artisan Console:** Generating code with a single command.
*   **Blade Engine:** Simple yet powerful templating.

Laravel handles the boring stuff (auth, routing, sessions) so I can focus on the business logic.
