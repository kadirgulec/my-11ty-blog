## Tools of the Trade

A developer is only as good as their tools. Here are the extensions I install immediately on a new machine:

### Essential Extensions
*   **PHP Intelephense:** Essential for code completion and navigation.
*   **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense:** Autocomplete for classes is a lifesaver.
*   **Laravel Blade Snippets:** Highlights Blade syntax correctly.
*   **GitLens:** To see who broke the code (usually me).

I also use the *GitHub Dark* theme to keep things easy on the eyes during late-night coding sessions.
