## The Best Investment for PHP Developers

If you are working with Laravel, **Laracasts** is non-negotiable. Jeffrey Way has a way of explaining complex topics that makes them feel incredibly simple.

### My Favorite Series
I recently finished the "Modern CSS for Backend Developers" series. It completely changed how I look at:

*   Flexbox and Grid
*   Utility classes
*   Responsive Design strategies

I highly recommend subscribing if you want to keep up with the TALL stack ecosystem.
